# Use of super with constructors
• super keyword can also be used to invoke the parent class constructor.
• super() if present, must always be the first statement executed inside a subclass super(); constructor. 
• When we invoke a super() statement from within a subclass constructor, we are invoking the immediate super class constructor.
